Adafruit Editorial Standards - 3/13/2017

**tl;dr**: Adafruit publishes a wide range of writing and video content, including interviews and reporting on the maker market and the wider technology world.  This document is intended as a guide to best practices that Adafruit uses, as well as an outline of the ethical standards Adafruit aspires to.  While Adafruit is not an independent journalistic institution, Adafruit strives to be a fair, informative, and positive voice within the community.

**Disclosure**
Adafruit Industries is a for-profit business with an interest in many of the subjects we cover.  As such, it would be irresponsible to claim the impartiality of not-for-profit journalism, therefore we be responsible for what and how we publish.  Adafruit designs, manufactures, and sells electronics.  Since Adafruit may cover subjects including our own products, suppliers, and direct competitors, we will make every reasonable effort to disclose:

* The identity of our writers and presenters, and their relationship to subjects under discussion.
* Our interests in the subject under discussion.
* Our relationship to products, vendors, services, and technologies.

**Our Goals**
*Fairness* - Our goal is to be fair, and to extend our platform to voices that otherwise might not be heard.

*Truthfulness, optimism, and good-faith engagement* - We will only cover subjects and topics we believe we have expertise in and can fairly evaluate. When we present problems, we will work to frame them as solvable.

Adafruit will generally avoid publishing anonymous sources, except in unusual circumstances (for example, if a source is a member of a vulnerable community that might be harmed by exposure and/or specifically requests anonymity, we may redact identifying details).  When using PACER Adafruit uses RECAP https://free.law/recap/ and will post the full PDF/source document.

**Rebuttals and Comment** - Adafruit will provide 3 business days (midnight ET) for review/comment, entire email posted in full with email address removed, however, verified via key and/or phone voice message / text with caller ID, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram...

**Commenting on Editorial Articles** - For editorial articles Adafruit may choose to disable comments, or moderate comments with confirmed email addresses or verification. Adafruit has a "be excellent to each other" comment policy. *“Help us keep the community here positive and helpful. Stick to the topic, be respectful of makers of all ages and skill levels. Be kind, and don't spam.”* Additionally Adafruit may choose to remove/block comments on the social media platforms it manages.

**Publishing** - Adafruit’s aim is to make content available to a wide audience and enable them to access content on their own terms.
